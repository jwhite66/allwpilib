Gazebo plugins for FRC
======================

These plugins enable the use of the Gazebo physics simulator to model robots,
and then use WPILIB programming libraries to control those simulated robots.

At the present time, this only builds on Linux, and has a fairly complex
installation process.

TODO:  Package the plugins more nicely, and then put instructions here.

TODO:  Build and package the plugins for Windows.  The key there is to get gazebo
working on Windows.  This link was a useful trove of information on Windows/Gazebo
issues as of September, 2017:
